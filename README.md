- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maxleface!
- 👀 I'm interested in overusing emoji and becoming the blandest I can be.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to bash my keyboard until words come out of it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on accelerating the heat death of the universe. Oh and games.
- 📫 I can't be reached at the moment, please try again next century.
